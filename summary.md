## What is the relationship between CO2 emissions and GDP per capita, by country and globally?

From our first set of charts, we found a clear correlation between counties with large CO2 emissions and a relatively large GDP. Another to note is that most developed countries, including the United States and most European countries, had CO2 emissions increase exponentially from 1800-present, while many undeveloped countries, such as Uzbekistan, had various dips and rises in their CO2 emissions over the years.

There were definitely a few outliers in the correlation graph, namely the countries of Kuwait, Qatar, and the UAE. These countries followed the general trend of CO2 emissions increasing with GDP, but both the CO2 and GDP were much higher than the other countries. Qatar specifically had a CO2 emission rate of almost 9 trillion tons, placing it in the upper echelon of our graph.

These trends, while surprising at first, made sense because countries with higher wealth have more resources to produce more products, which therefore would correlate with greater CO2 emissions.

## Does a higher standard of living mean a higher renewable energy consumption, either by country or globally?

With this set of graphs we found that generally, as a country's Human Development Index (HDI) improves, the renewable energy consumption is also lower. This trend was mirrored with many of the countries' individual trends. For most countries, the average HDI went up from 1990-present, while the average renewable energy consumption has fluctuated.

Even though many wealthier countries, like Switzerland, have increased their renewable energy consumption over the last two decades, when we look at the scatterplot with all countries, wealthier countries have lower relative renewable energy consumption levels than poorer countries.

This correlation makes sense, because as a country's GDP grows, so does its industrialization, including the amount of factories, transportation, and other infrastructure that add more CO2 into the atmosphere. As a country becomes more industrialized, it gets harder for it to convert to renewable energy, which is the main reason why we can see countries with a greater HDI with lower relative renewable energy consumption levels than the countries with lower HDIs.

## What is the relationship between CO2 emissions when comparing countries directly?
In our last set of graphs, we found that the total global CO2 emissions has risen at a mostly steady rate from 1990 to the present. Changing the year for the total CO2 emissions graph shows that each year, different countries have outputted the most CO2, with wealthier countries such as Canada and Poland consistently outputting more emissions than poorer countries such as Kenya or Afghanistan. Additionally, as the year increases, so does the total amount of CO2 emissions, corroborating what the first chart on that tab shows us.

These charts show us that the global trend is similar to the trends of individual countries we saw in previous charts. CO2 levels are rising as more and more countries either become industrialized or increase their industrialization to become wealthier.

Throughout this project, we have found out that wealthier, developed nations output significantly more CO2 than developing nations, signifying that if we we want to decrease the amount of CO2 but also maintain wealth, we need to find a way to incorporate renewable energy into the production of GDP.
