#### Project:
>[Alaska Ocean Acidification Research: Autonomous Observations of Ocean Acidification in Alaska Coastal Seas](https://oceanacidification.noaa.gov/CurrentProjects/GulfofAlaska.aspx#)

#### Summary
>The project is run by JESSICA CROSS, NOAA ALASKA FISHERIES SCIENCE CENTER giving new insights into the seasonal progression of OA events caused by the progressive accumulation of anthropogenic CO2 into the region's coastal seas. The mooring and cruise data can also be used as an early warning system for stakeholders around the state, as well as to provide information for other types of OA research.

#### Project:
>[Global Carbon Project
The Science Framework
and Implementation](https://www.globalcarbonproject.org/global/pdf/GCPFrameworkFinal.pdf)

#### Summary
>The Global Carbon Project is designed to make the links
between the fundamental research on global change and
the Earth System carried out in the programs themselves and issues of vital concern for people. The project emphasizes on the carbon-climate human system, develops new methodologies for analyzing and
modeling the integrated carbon cycle addresses questions of direct policy
relevance, such as the management strategies and sustainable regional development pathways required to achieve
stabilization of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, and seeks g to engage the industrial and energy sectors as well
as the economic development and resource management
sectors in the developing regions of the world.
#### Project
>[Global Non-linear Effect of Temperature on Economic Production](https://web.stanford.edu/~mburke/climate/index.html)

#### Summary
>The project was published online in 2015 addressing how economic output around the world been affected by changes in temperature and precipitation and implication of the potential future impacts of climate change. The result shows that changes in temperature have substantially shaped economic growth in both rich and poor countries over the last half-century, and that future warming is likely to reduce global economic output, relative to a world without climate change.
