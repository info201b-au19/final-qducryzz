# Final Project Brainstorm
Use this `REAMDE.md` file to describe your final project (as detailed on Canvas).
## Domain of Interest
We choose CO2 emission as our field of study due to our shared interest in climate change and natural environments. At the same time, we think the natural environment plays an important role in our daily life, so we want to get to know more about the correlation between humans and the environment.

#### Project 1:
>[Alaska Ocean Acidification Research: Autonomous Observations of Ocean Acidification in Alaska Coastal Seas](https://oceanacidification.noaa.gov/CurrentProjects/GulfofAlaska.aspx#)

#### Summary
>The project is run by JESSICA CROSS, NOAA ALASKA FISHERIES SCIENCE CENTER giving new insights into the seasonal progression of OA events caused by the progressive accumulation of anthropogenic CO2 into the region's coastal seas. The mooring and cruise data can also be used as an early warning system for stakeholders around the state, as well as to provide information for other types of OA research.

#### Project 2:
>[Global Carbon Project
The Science Framework
and Implementation](https://www.globalcarbonproject.org/global/pdf/GCPFrameworkFinal.pdf)

#### Summary
>The Global Carbon Project is designed to make the links
between the fundamental research on global change and
the Earth System carried out in the programs themselves and issues of vital concern for people. The project emphasizes on the carbon-climate human system, develops new methodologies for analyzing and
modeling the integrated carbon cycle addresses questions of direct policy
relevance, such as the management strategies and sustainable regional development pathways required to achieve
stabilization of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, and seeks g to engage the industrial and energy sectors as well
as the economic development and resource management
sectors in the developing regions of the world.
#### Project 3ï¼š
>[Global Non-linear Effect of Temperature on Economic Production](https://web.stanford.edu/~mburke/climate/index.html)

#### Summary
>The project was published online in 2015 addressing how economic output around the world been affected by changes in temperature and precipitation and implication of the potential future impacts of climate change. The result shows that changes in temperature have substantially shaped economic growth in both rich and poor countries over the last half-century, and that future warming is likely to reduce global economic output, relative to a world without climate change.

## Finding Data

### Data on Greenhouse Emissions
[Data on co2 emission per country per capita in from 1751 - 2014](http://cdiac.ornl.gov/ftp/ndp030/CSV-FILES/nation.1751_2014.csv), this shows the equivalent in metric tons of CO2 greenhouse emissions per capita for each country 

Source: Data comes from the Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center (CDIAC) a subdepartment of the United States Department of Energy

Number of Rows: 17232

Number of Columns: 10

Questions: The data can be used to track the changing in total greenhouse emissions for each country and be used with other data to find correlation with greenhouse emissions and desired variables, e.g. how emissions relate with the quality of life of a country.

### Data on the Human Development Index
>[Human Development Index](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/human-development-index-hdi/resource/4a7fd374-7e35-4c04-b7c8-25e5943aa476), shows the composite index of life expectancy, education, and per capita income which are used to give each country a value which shows the overall quality of life for the residents of said country from 1980 to 2013
Source: UNDP Human Development Reports Office (HDRO)
Number of Rows: 2122

Number of Columns: 9

Questions: Can be used to compare the quality of life for residents of a country and the total CO2 emissions over time showing how countries which have very high emissions per capita tend to have a higher quality of life.
